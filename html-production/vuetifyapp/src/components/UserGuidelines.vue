        				You may not recall registering for an account before using Let’s Talk Journaling, and that’s how it should be! Logging in is a seamless process that occurs automatically when you use your Google Assistant device. Let’s Talk Journaling utilizes your Google Account for authentication - the same one that you used to set up your devices, which means that you have one less login to remember, and your data is securely backed up across all your devices. This allows you to start at home, and be able to pick up on any other Google Assistant device where you left off!
        			</p>
        		<strong><li>Setup</li></strong>
        			<p>
        				Let’s Talk Journaling is an Action available on all Google Assistant platforms, compatible with the following types of Google Assistant-enabled devices: Google Home & smart speakers, Android 5.0+ phones, Android 6.0+ tablets, Android 6.0+ TVs, Chrome OS devices (Chromebook and Chromebox), iOS 9.0+ phones, and headphones.
        				<br/><br/>Setup is an extremely easy task. Follow these simple instructions to get started:

              <ol type="1">
              <br>
              <li class="directions">
        				Open the Assistant app on the device you wish to install the program on.
        				<p>
        					<strong>NOTE</strong>: If the Assistant app is not installed, it is available on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store. If you wish to install it on a device without a screen, such as a smart speaker, you will need to use the device which you set it up with (e.g. the Home app for Google Home speakers).

        					Once Let’s Talk Journaling has been connected to your Google Assistant, entering and using the system is incredibly simple! You won’t see an app icon on your device because it is launched through the Assistant.
        					<br><br>
        				To enter the program, follow these simple instructions:
        			<ol type="1">
              <br>
        			<li class="directions">
        				Open the Google Assistant.
        				<p>
        					<strong>NOTE</strong>: Refer to your device’s manual for instructions on how to access Google Assistant. These instructions vary by device type and manufacturer.

        		<a name="Initialize"></a>
        		<strong><li>Initializing the Conversation</li></strong>
        			<p>
        				Let’s Talk Journaling is centered on being able to speak to you and make you feel better! You can freely talk to the app and it will listen to everything that you have to say. It will also save your conversations much like a diary so that you can come back to your days and see your feeling for the day as well as what you had to say that day. 
        				<br><br>
        			<strong>To begin the conversation, follow these simple instructions:</strong>
              </p>
        		<ol type="1">
        		<li class="directions">
        			Launch the application (see <a href=#Enter>Entering the Application</a>).<br>
        			<img src="@/assets/assistantmain.png" alt="Assistant" style="width:250px;height:500px; border:2px solid black">
        		</li>
            <br>
        		<li class="directions">
        			Follow the Assistant’s instructions and respond to questions as prompted.
        		</li>
        		</ol>

        		<strong><li>Exiting the Application</li></strong>
            <br>
        				Let’s Talk Journaling is able to take advantage of Google Assistant’s natural language, and utilizes the same basic phrases in other Actions you’ve come to enjoy.
        				<br/><br/>When you are finished using the program or wish to end the program, use one of the following phrases:

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        		<li class="directions">
        			Exit
        		</li>
        		<li class="directions">
        			Cancel
        		</li>
        		<li class="directions">
        			Stop
        		</li>
        		<li class="directions">
        			Nevermind

        		<li class="directions">
        			Goodbye
