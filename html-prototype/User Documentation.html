				You may not recall registering for an account before using Let’s Talk, and that’s how it should be! Logging in is a seamless process that occurs automatically when you use your Google Assistant device. Let’s Talk utilizes your Google Account for authentication - the same one that you used to set up your devices, which means that you have one less login to remember, and your data is securely backed up across all your devices. This allows you to start at home, and be able to pick up on any other Google Assistant device where you left off!
